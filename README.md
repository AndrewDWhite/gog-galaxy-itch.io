# gog-galaxy-itch.io

An integration for itch.io

Based heavily on [Ertego's itch.io integration](https://github.com/Ertego/gog-galaxy-itch.io) and [burnhamup's Indiegala integration](https://github.com/burnhamup/galaxy-integration-indiegala)

Please use the download via the releases page as the repo itself does not contain any dependencies. 

Note that many games on Itch are not listed in IGDB and therefore will show up as "Unknown Game". You can help fix this by adding them on [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/)
