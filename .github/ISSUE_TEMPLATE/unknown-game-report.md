A game is being imported as "Unknown Game" in GOG and therefore isn't showing up in the library.
Since GOG maintains a database in order to prevent duplicates and merge games across platforms, games that do not appear in that database will show as "Unknown Game" in Galaxy. 
Please fill in as many of these as you can, to help document and reproduce which games are not in the GOG database. Some of these pages may not exist.

Steam or other store link:

Itch.io ID:
You can find the itch.io ID by looking in the plugin log file (path found [here](https://github.com/Mixaill/awesome-gog-galaxy#installation-and-debugging)) and searching for the game's name, which will be followed by its ID.

GOG Database lookup link:
This will be of the form https://gamesdb.gog.com/platforms/itch/external_releases/{id}, where {id} is replaced by the itch.io ID.
